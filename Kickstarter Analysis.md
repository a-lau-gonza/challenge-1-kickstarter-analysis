# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
   The analysis of Louise's gathered data on Kickstarter campaigns provides the background on learning how to navigate large clusters of data through Excel. The basis of understanding the analysis of the data within Excel will prove as a foundation for many other data analysis projects to come.
### Purpose
   The purpose of this analysis that I have gleamed is to familiarize myself to the ins and outs of navigating Excel. It provides a basic understanding on the specificity that code is in what it can do when implemented correctly or incorrectly as well as how to use the program to find and organize information needed for analysis. It also provides a lens for how to interpret the data given to make certain decisions and predictions in relation to the proposed project.

   From the point of view for Louise, this data collected can give a good perspective of when to launch her own kickstarter as well as what projects based on genre/form of performance does well in other instances. 
## Analysis and Challenges
   From the data sorted and organized, my findings for Louise were that both when and how large of a goal the kickstarter has will affect the how probable success of the project launched will be. 
   The month where the most successful campaigns for theater are launched being in May with a downward trend to September with November, December, and January being the lowest successfull campaigns for funding. If Louise would like to improve her chances, the end of US Spring leading to the beginning of Autumn are the best times to launch. However, this isn't the only trend found among the data.

   The financial goal of the campaign is also a large contributor in the probability of success.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
